        "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/grace-jisun-kim/ebola-and-thomas-eric-dun_b_5984056.html?utm_hp_ref=black-voices&ir=Black+Voices\n",
        "When Thomas Eric Duncan, a visitor from Liberia, became ill in Dallas on September 24, he went, as many people do, to the local hospital emergency room. However, serious questions must be raised about what happened when he did. <br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "Duncan entered the hospital with perspiration, vomiting, a fever of 103\u00b0F and stomach cramps. He said that he was from West Africa.  Many believe the hospital should have suspected Ebola. But the hospital somehow ignored or <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2788334/Ebola-patient-arrived-ER-103-degree-fever.html\" target=\"_hplink\">misread Duncan's symptoms</a> and failed to diagnose his condition and provide an appropriate treatment. After a series of tests, Duncan was <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2788334/Ebola-patient-arrived-ER-103-degree-fever.html\" target=\"_hplink\">sent home with antibiotics</a> and told to take a pain medication.<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "Duncan's condition deteriorated and he returned to the hospital on September 28. He was diagnosed with Ebola but rather than being treated right away, he was just provided a hospital bed and was in isolation. <br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "Duncan finally received <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/09/health/ebola-duncan-death-cause/index.html\" target=\"_hplink\">experimental medicine</a> on October 4 which was six days after he was admitted.  Treatment was too late and Duncan died on October 8. The misdiagnosis and resulting delay in the beginning of treatment may have contributed to Duncan's death.  It certainly put other people at risk: Duncan's family, his friends, and the people with whom he came in contact. (On October 12, it was reported that a Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas nurse who treated Duncan came down with symptoms. The nurse has tested <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/articles/texas-health-care-worker-tests-positive-for-ebola-says-health-department-1413112243\" target=\"_hplink\">positive for the Ebola virus</a>.)<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "People have responded to the events surrounding Thomas Eric Duncan's diagnosis of Ebola and his death in a variety of ways. The <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/10/07/dallas-county-prosecutor-considering-criminal-charges-against-ebola-patient-in-texas/\" target=\"_hplink\">Dallas County prosecutor</a> considered criminal charges against Duncan to examine whether he intentionally exposed the public to Ebola.  Critics of President Obama have shamelessly exploited the situation to say that the <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2014/10/10/fox_pundit_obama_thinks_we_should_suffer_along_with_less_fortunate_nations/\" target=\"_hplink\">president is allowing Ebola</a> and the fear of Ebola to spread.  As we answer such ridiculous thinking with a resounding \"no\", hard questions remain.<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "The misdiagnosis and delay in treating Thomas Eric Duncan is disturbing. His <a href=\"http://hotair.com/archives/2014/10/10/report-american-ebola-victim-was-symptomatic-when-he-was-released-by-dallas-hospital/\" target=\"_hplink\">symptoms and the fact that Thomas Eric Duncan was from West Africa</a> should have sent warning signs to admit him for further tests. But rather they dismissed him.<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "Was Duncan turned away because he did not have insurance or because of his <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/8/6941749/ebola-panic-is-getting-pretty-racist\" target=\"_hplink\">foreign accent and skin color</a>?  <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ebola-virus-outbreak/ebola-victim-thomas-eric-duncan-sent-home-hospital-103-fever-n223296\" target=\"_hplink\">Many argue</a> that <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/grace-jisun-kim/ebola-outbreak-and-outcry_b_5943216.html\" target=\"_hplink\">he was</a>.   Duncan's experience echoes the realities revealed in Ferguson, Missouri. Ferguson reminds us that some are discriminated against due to the color of one's skin and others will not.  Ferguson reminds us that inequality still exists in much of the United States.  Ferguson reminds us that there is a disparity and gap between the rich and poor.<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "The death of Thomas Eric Duncan challenges us to consider the factors that affect how medical treatment is provided. From Nebraska to Dallas, all must be treated equally and with the highest care.  Duncan's treatment came late while the other three Ebola patients in America received treatment right away.  We all know that <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/news/20140731/theres-no-ebola-cure-but-early-intensive-treatment-boosts-survival\" target=\"_hplink\">early treatment</a> leads to better success.  We must learn from Thomas Eric Duncan's case. The other Ebola patients treated on America soil survived, but Duncan did not.  All must be treated equally with the highest care and compassion.<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "During the time of Jesus, Simon the leper had the disease of his time.  People were saying, \"unclean, unclean\" and put him in a quarantine shelter.  The isolation, fear, hatred, ignorance and violence abounded. Rather than distancing himself from Simon the leper, Jesus was with him during his last week on earth (Matthew 26:6). <br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "We who follow Jesus, remember that he had compassion and healed the sick without distinction, without regard to who they were. He saw beyond the external factors to see the person in need and then responded to that need. He calls us to do the same: to become aware of disparities and the discrepancies in how people of different ethnicities and economic statuses are treated here in the United States, and then to join together to work for the day when all people receive equal treatment. <br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "The death of Thomas Eric Duncan and the presence of Ebola remind us of how small and interrelated the world is. What affects some of us directly, will ultimately affect most, if not all of us, indirectly. It is a reminder that the world needs books, schools, hospitals and medicine.  Not guns and bombs. It is a reminder that we must learn to help one another out rather than turn our backs on each other. The nations and people of the world must pull together to help one another.  Acting together for the good of all humanity must be our motto on this small blue planet where our lives intersect with each other. We all need each other and we need to be there for one another. And we must not be late.<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "Thomas Eric Duncan received a late diagnosis.  His treatment for Ebola was too late.  We have lost Thomas Eric Duncan. Our prayers are with his family and friends.\n",

        "If you love the Swedish aesthetic of IKEA but hate <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/29/ikeafail-hashtag_n_5890010.html\" target=\"_hplink\">the time and frustration that often comes with the assembling it</a>, you're in luck -- you now have some choices.<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "The first option is still IKEA, but this new collection promises to go \"from flatpack to furniture in less than five minutes.\" Well, as IKEA US Product PR Representative Janice Simonsen told HuffPost Home via email, \"It's actually closer to 10 to 15 minutes.\" <br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "Either way, the line is known as REGISS\u00d6R, and the majority of its assembly is possible without tools, though there is a base that needs to be assembled via conventional hardware. The non-tool pieces from it feature special wedge dowels for assembly. The entire line, which includes a bookcase, a coffee table and several cabinets, <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_eye/2014/10/06/ikea_regissor_series_a_bookshelf_cabinets_and_coffee_table_you_can_assemble.html\" target=\"_hplink\">range from $139 to $349</a>. The pieces are made from a lighter, mostly hollow material that reduces stress on furniture joints.<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "\"The beauty of the design is that it creates a sturdy but lightweight product, reducing weight and shipping costs and reducing the amount of material needed for the final product,\" Simonsen said. \"This creates a big 'win-win' in terms of the sustainability of the product.\"<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "But if you're not willing to wait until the line debuts in the spring (and if you have some extra funds lying around), there's a pretty good chance you're going to be a major fan of Hem.<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "Swedish for \"home\" and launched by <a href=\"http://fab.com/\" target=\"_hplink\">the company Fab</a>, Hem is marketing itself as \"the first <a href=\"http://hem.com/\" target=\"_hplink\">affordable high-end design brand</a> created to serve online-direct customers.\" In other words, as Hem's VP of Communications, D\u00e9sir\u00e9e Maurd, told HuffPost Home via email, \"We sell to the end-consumer directly from our own online store. In the (high-end) design furniture industry this is not very common -- usually you need to find a retailer.\"<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "It'll still cost you double (or even triple) for a Hem table than it would for one from IKEA, but it might be worth the investment, as the brand claims on its website to \"obsess over materials and finishes to create products you'll want to hold on to for a very long time.\"<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "\"There's an apparent demand for alternatives for consumers graduating from IKEA, wanting higher quality, thorough design and authentic materials,\" Maurd added. \"We are definitely producing higher-end designs than say, IKEA, with high quality finishes and materials. We are not targeting the lower end or value end of the market.\"<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "And, while the verdict's still out on <a href=\"http://instagram.com/hemishere\" target=\"_hplink\">the global brand that just launched a few days ago</a>, Hem does also offer customizable options that might just give them a leg up on the competition.<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "Take a peek at some pieces from Hem and see for yourself if this is the IKEA alternative you've been wishing for, or if you're just fine waiting until the new IKEA line debuts.<br />\n",

        "<em>\"I don't want to be labeled as gay ... [and] I'm not African-American. I'm American.\"</em><br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "The moment those words blared out of the TV, my Twitter timeline and Facebook newsfeed flooded with angry comments from my fellow black lesbians condemning 28-year-old former Cosby kid and Disney star Raven-Symon\u00e9. In an interview with Oprah Winfrey, Raven laid out her post-racial belief system, claiming that she doesn't want to be labeled \"gay\" or even \"African-American\" but \"a human who loves humans.\" If Raven believes for a moment that her relationship with the beautiful, gender-bending model AzMarie Livingston or her history on the show that represented and redefined the black American family in the 20th century do not loudly communicate who she is, then she is mistaken and a bit confused. <br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "I definitely shook my head in disbelief at what Raven said, but it didn't spark immediate anger in me. Raven missed the mark, and despite what she told Winfrey, she couldn't effectively articulate her position, but I never expected \"baby Raven,\" as Melissa Harris-Perry called her, to possess the acumen to formulate any profound statement about race, identity, or sexuality in America. In fact, when news broke that Raven was dating a woman, I silently prayed that she wouldn't be thrust to the forefront of any feminist, lesbian, or black movements. It's funny how that happens sometimes: Pretty, famous, rich woman of color starts proclaiming lesbianism (or feminism), and all of a sudden she's the official spokeswoman for an entire generation of woman warriors who've been doing this work for years. I'm not here for that. Therefore, unlike some of my black lesbian sisters, I wasn't disappointed in the fact that Raven hadn't risen to the occasion and utilized this very public interview to position herself as the image of black lesbianism in America. Quite frankly, I don't trust her with our movement. After all, this is the woman whose response to the advancement of marriage equality was to tweet \"Yay government.\"<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "Apparently, Raven thinks that denouncing labels that she believes don't serve her purposes will, in some magical way, free her from racism and homophobia. She has it backwards. Rather than being harmful, owning her race and identifying as a lesbian could make things easier for her. As Dr. Beverly Tatum, the author of <em>\"Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria?\" and Other Conversations About Race</em>, noted in a 1992 article that \"students of color who have had the opportunity to examine the ways in which racism may have affected their own lives are able to give voice to their own experience, and to validate it rather than be demoralized by it.\" Raven is sadly unaware that by claiming both of those identities, she becomes part of a blooming, strong, passionate, resilient, powerful, sensual, educated group. Black lesbians rock! <br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "Refusing a label or claiming humanism does not excuse Raven from the responsibility she bears as a participant in communities where people are fighting and dying to exist. Nor does it help deconstruct the racist, homophobic systems prevalent in America. Her first steps into post-racial rhetoric were as wobbly as a toddler's, but I was more embarrassed for her than I was angry. Instead, I wished Raven had known of sister Audre Lorde's famous words from the 1982 address \"Learning From the '60s.\"<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "<blockquote>Either I denied or chose between various aspects of my identity, or my work and my Blackness would be unacceptable. As a Black lesbian mother in an interracial marriage, there was usually some part of me guaranteed to offend everybody's comfortable prejudices of who I should be. That is how I learned that if I didn't define myself for myself, I would be crunched into other people's fantasies for me and eaten alive. </blockquote><br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "I think Raven needs Lorde's wisdom as she charts a path for herself. Denying any part of oneself is equally as harmful as accepting those unwanted labels from society, and perhaps worse. As a black woman in a same-sex relationship, Raven seems to want it both ways, but she can't prance through life reaping the benefits of the various communities that she refuses to stake a claim in. If we, the participants in black lesbianism and womanhood, fail to proclaim, through various postures, who we are, if we neglect to define and label ourselves for ourselves, then we run the risk of further invisibilizing ourselves, our communities, our struggle, our history, and, inevitably, our future.\n",

If I were single and looking for a partner, this interaction (or lack thereof) would be very disheartening. <br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "On the surface, black women's behavior appear rude and standoffish; but their actions are not without merit. Contrary to popular belief, we don't live in a society full of bitter and angry black women. This anti-social behavior is simply a defense mechanism. From the point they leave the house until they return home, black women are bombarded by black men approaching them from every direction. As a result, black men's uniqueness has been watered down. We are merely viewed as a bunch of street merchants unidentifiable amongst the masses?  We might have a different pitch, but we're all selling the same thing. Thus, there is no motivation for black women to want to entertain a conversation.<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "If I am accurate in capturing black women's perspective, how do we change the general opinion? More importantly, how do we restore the institution of marriage within the black community? The lines of communication between black men and women have to improve. One simple suggestion I have for all the single black ladies out there is to \"Just Say Hi!\" Obviously, there is a risk in speaking because there are some egotistical, self-absorbed black men out there who will interpret your \"Hi\" as something greater. If it is something more, continue to explore the possibilities. If not, promptly and sternly end the conversation and wait for the next black male encounter. <br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "This trial-by-error approach can bring about a lot of headaches, as you will come in contact with all sorts of personalities. But I see no other way to address the issue. While unpleasant at times, it's a necessary sacrifice for the greater good of the black community. If we continue to trend down the current path, the number of unwed black women will grow from 42 percent to 62 percent in the blink of an eye. So if not for you, do it for all your fellow single ladies out there.<br />\n",

        "Bille Woodruff likes to have fun, but the party for <i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LErjzY_wKI\" target=\"_hplink\">Addicted</a></i> the night before was a little too much. He had possibly three vodka-laced house drinks foisted upon him, and a long shower was needed this Thursday morning to get his mojo up to par. But, truthfully, he looked no worse for wear, and much, much younger than someone who's been directing music videos (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uesdoK4Mji4\" target=\"_hplink\">Toni Braxton</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPCwPe4Tk-4\" target=\"_hplink\">Celine Dion</a>, Britney Spears, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiqfsXm7VnU\" target=\"_hplink\">Luther Vandross</a>) for almost a quarter of a century ought to. <br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "Admittedly, this director of the films <i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmN4tdA-2Qg\" target=\"_hplink\">Beauty Shop</a></i> with Queen Latifah and <i>Honey</i> with Jessica Alba was a bit anxious. His latest effort, <i>Addicted</i>, was opening on the next day nationwide. A faithful adaptation of erotica queen Zane's million copy bestseller, the romancer showcases the posteriors of William Levy, Tyson Beckford, and Boris Kodjoe as they try to satisfy Sharon Leal's Zoe, who's suffering from a hardy case of sex addiction that's destroying both her marriage and career.<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "\"It is nerve-wracking,\" Woodruff shared, \"because you work so hard on a movie, and you put your heart and soul into it, but because of the way the business works now, everything is a quick headline. A quick blurb. All your work boils down to one weekend really no matter how good the movie is.\"<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "\"But I'm really happy with the film,\" he added, \"and I think people will really like it. I wasn't like this a couple of weekends ago, but somehow this week I feel really happy that people will get to see it. So regardless of the numbers, I'm actually feeling calmer than I ever had when I had a movie opening. I think it's one of the best things I've ever done.\"<br />\n",

        "<br />\n",
        "Woodruff needn't have worried. <i>Addicted</i> had the highest gross per theatre over the weekend of any wide release. According to <i>Variety</i>, its audience's makeup was 72% African-American, 15% Latino, and 82% female. Why? Because before Woodruff, very few filmmakers were willing to explore a black woman's sexuality on her own terms.<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "Even <i>The New York Times</i>, which proffered a mixed reaction to the film, noted there was a  \"propulsive energy\" to the lust scenes and \"if there were an award for best-looking cast,\" <i>Addicted</i> would be the winner.<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "Besides bumping up the heat in malls across the country, Woodruff, whose dream projects are biopics of James Baldwin and Langston Hughes, wants to showcase black men as they really are and not as stereotypes. He had already accomplished this in his many videos, especially those with the Tony Rich Project and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVi25pSRAkc\" target=\"_hplink\">Joe</a>.<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "\"I believe in the diversity of all the different colors and shades of human beings,\" Woodruff insisted.  \"So for me, I love when you see a black person being a villain because to me there's power in that. Because I think that there's a kind of power being taken away if the black characters always have to be perfect or kind of asexual, like the character that's the police chief or whatever who doesn't really get angry or curse. There's empowerment in using positive images, but in reality, if you want to have people realize how much we are really all the same, you have show the diversity of the human condition. I'm interested in showing black men in all their different shades the same way everyone else is shown.\"<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "Watching the recent news concerning Ferguson and all that followed across the country has caused Woodruff to want emulate one of his early heroes, Spike Lee, even more than he has in the past. \"I thought race relations would be getting better by now,\" he noted. \"I remember being in high school, and I'm from Richmond, Virginia. I had a white girlfriend, and we just automatically knew like when we were out and she was in the passenger seat that if we saw a police car, she would duck down. You knew maybe they would think I did something or that I had abducted her\"<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "Then there was the incident in Washington, DC, when Woodruff was attending the University of Maryland, College Park. \"I think I weighed a buck fifty, and I was not threatening to anyone. I was leaving a nightclub with two of my friends, and I won't bore you with the whole long story, but I ended up having 5 police cars stop me and a police motorcycle that my car ran over because they yanked me out before I could turn on the brakes. They beat me, and rammed my head repeatedly into the windshield. It was horrible, and I hadn't done anything.\"<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "\"So, yes, in life, I've experienced racism, but I also experienced the opposite as well. I think it's what you gravitate to, and I do feel that the world is getting better, but I have to say these recent things, they really are sad to me because I thought that we were moving further ahead.\"<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "At least, Woodruff's career is leaping forward. He's directed the much awaited sequel to <i>Drumline</i>, which will air on VH1 on October 27th, and he can rest assured that <i>Addicted</i> has more than a few more money-making weeks at the box office before it hits stores as a DVD and becomes a Netflix sensation. There's also chatter of another Zane adaptation, which wouldn't surprise his friends.<br />\n",

This is the world of fashion and the fashion industry has been dressing people for hundreds of years. I saw a void and want to use this opportunity to fill a substantial gap that currently exists between the fashion world and the wearables space.</p><br />\n",

        "<p>Wearables are in their infancy. Twenty years from now, devices already on the market will look like they are from Prehistoric times both from a design and a functionality point of view. My mission is to up the game in wearables, to create devices that step up and deliver in terms of fashion, features and functionality.</p><br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "<p>Through success achieved via my music career, and then venturing into consumer electronics, I have always carved out time for philanthropic activities at the same time.

        "<p>My <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/william?ref=br_tf\">\"day job\"</a> as a musician is what got me to this point - made me famous and gave me a platform to be an advocate for what I think is important: a good education for every high school student, and even better, an education that is focused on STEM skills development. And now, my new venture in consumer tech and wearables gives me a way to demonstrate and justify why kids should take an interest in STEM education, to walk the walk vs. just talk.</p><br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "<p>Success in wearables isn't going to be driven by the giants of yesteryear. Instead it is going to be developed and brought to market by the unlikely candidate. It's going to be the person with the best idea, regardless of size of company, or maybe one creative person with a kernel of an idea who doesn't working for a company at all. It could be kids from Boyle Heights, the South Bronx, the Fourth Ward, <a href=\"http://www.theprincestrust.co.uk\">South London</a>, <a href=\"https://www.onemillionyoungideas.org.uk/\">Hackney</a>, or Brixton.</p><br />\n",

        "<p>So far it's working: student grades at the <a href=\"http://www.iamcollegetrack.org\">i.am College Track</a> center have gone from 1.0 to 3.5 and 4.0 averages.

I'm a creative person, but can honestly say that focusing on music alone has never tapped my potential in the same way that I am working right now. The merging of many functions required to create and deliver a fresh approach to wearables includes design, fashion, coding, app development, 3D printing, manufacturing and marketing excites me.

        "Removal from school as a disciplinary measure, while potentially the easiest short-term solution, feeds the school-to-prison cycle that is built primarily in urban schools. Instead, mentorship programs would go a long way toward directing urban students toward higher academic engagement and graduation rates. Many colleges have implemented mentorship programs for at-risk students, like first-generation college students, so why can't K-12 schools do the same?<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "With budget cuts a perennial complaint, though, more money for K-12 mentorship initiatives is unlikely. The bottom line is that urban students need more individual attention in order for their academic outlooks to improve. Technology has the potential to reach a wider number of students but the human connection is what will have a lasting positive impact on urban students.<br />\n",

        "In my book <em>The Call to Teach: An Introduction to Teaching</em> I explore the \"real world\" of teaching, particularly how new educators are ill-prepared to face the challenges of teaching in urban settings. Traditional university programs for K-12 educators do not adequately prepare students for what awaits them in the urban schools of America where the achievement gap and dropout rates are highest. <br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "In the face of these obstacles, strong teaching in America's urban schools is the key to overcoming dropout and achievement gap issues. Recruiting teachers with urban backgrounds -- and then rewarding them is one strategy. In addition, urban student teachers should be required to spend at least a few hours in an urban classroom, in addition to their other teaching assignments. <br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "Seeing urban challenges firsthand must be part of every educator's path to a degree, even if he or she never teaches full time in such a classroom.  With the right guidance, urban K-12 students can rise above their circumstances to be stand-outs in academics. They may even return the favor as teachers themselves one day. For urban teachers, and therefore students, to succeed they need more support and encouragement from their industry, government and society as a whole.<br />\n",

        "<br />By Lawrence Hurley                <br />WASHINGTON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Civil rights lawyers on  Wednesday asked a U.S. Supreme Court justice to block a Texas  law requiring voters in the state to show certain forms of  identification in order to cast a ballot.                <br />The move comes after a U.S. appeals court on Tuesday blocked  a lower court decision that had struck down the law, meaning the  measure would be in effect for the November elections if the  Supreme Court does not intervene.                <br />The request, made to Justice Anton Scalia, was filed by  lawyers representing various plaintiffs who challenged the law,  including the League of United Latin American Citizens.                <br />The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  granted a request filed by the state asking for last week's  ruling by U.S. District Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos to be put on  hold pending appeal.                <br />The court papers were filed with Scalia because he has  responsibility for handling emergency applications that arise  from states covered by the 5th Circuit.                <br />The district court judge wrote that the 2011 law, which was  challenged by the administration of President Barack Obama and  civil rights groups, was unlawful under a federal law called the  Voting Rights Act and the U.S. Constitution in part because it  discriminates against minority voters.                <br />The law is one of a series enacted in Republican-governed  states requiring voters to show certain forms of identification  before being allowed to vote. Republicans say the measures are  intended to curb voter fraud. Democrats say the laws are  designed to reduce the turnout of certain groups of voters  including minorities who tend to vote for Democratic candidates.
