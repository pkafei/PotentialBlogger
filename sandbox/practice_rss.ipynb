        "<strong>The Huffington Post: What did your journey to becoming an integral part of queer nightlife in New York City entail?</strong><br />\n",
        "<a href=\"http://www.darrellthorne.com/\" target=\"_hplink\">Darrell Thorne</a>: My first experience working in nightlife was actually in Los Angeles -- I started out as a go-go boy in a few different clubs. When I moved to New York 12 years ago I didn't have any inclination that I would be working in nightlife. However, I do remember being very excited by the number of costume-themed events which seemed to happen constantly. At that point, my only experience with costuming was around Halloween, and I had barely touched makeup. <br />\n",
        " <br />\n",
        "Derek Jackson was an artist working in the city at the time, and he approached me to do a photo shoot shortly after I arrived in town. It was to be shot on Easter weekend and I was also go-go dancing at the Slide that same day -- I suggested that I do the shoot costumed as Jesus. Derek agreed, did my makeup for the shoot and it was a thrilling and liberating experience for me. Over the course of the next year we did several collaborative performances, with Derek designing my costumes and makeup. Eventually he left town and I realized that I wanted to continue the journey, so I started creating my own costumes and applying my own makeup. I was hooked. I would go anywhere that a costume was encouraged or accepted: parades, parties, clubs.  As time passed, my skills improved and I met more people and eventually started to get bookings for work. I've been fortunate to catch the eyes of some well-connected people -- such as Earl Dax, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/07/muffinhead-after-dark_n_5461416.html\" target=\"_hplink\">Muffinhead</a>, Susanne Bartsch, Brandon Voss -- all of whom afforded me opportunities to work more, gain exposure and further develop my craft. <br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "<strong>How would you describe your aesthetic and the work that you produce? </strong><br />\n",
        "I always find this a little challenging to answer, but I tend to say that I'm a performance artist who works in costume and makeup.  My work revolves around creating a highly-detailed visual character or characters -- usually with fantasy, tribal, futuristic, urban, organic, cinematic, or religious influences -- and then inhabiting those characters in a performance. Certainly my work is concerned with creating the \"look,\" but performing the character (whether through a durational installation or movement or dance) is equally as important and enjoyable in my creative process. Outside of nightlife, I have a range of expressions for my work, including producing events with multiple performers in my costumes/makeup, performing installations in gallery settings, cabaret and theater performances, and appearances in music videos and fashion editorials. <br />\n",

        "<br />\n",
        "<strong>You've been involved in NYC nightlife for some time. How have you developed as an artist over the years?</strong><br />\n",
        "I think I've had the opportunity to hone my skills quite a bit. The more I produce and perform, the tighter (and looser) things can become. Over the past few years I've been working on a much more regular basis, and often creating looks for multiple people quite frequently. The time crunch and pressure to continually deliver has actually been fantastic for the creative process. Shortcuts and mistakes -- and outright panic -- can lead to some wonderful discoveries that I might not have happened upon otherwise. I've learned to trust myself more, and am able to be a bit more relaxed in the studio and not quite as controlling. Additionally, different clubs/nights call for different moods, and for my own stimulation I try to push myself outside my boundaries as much as I can.    <br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "<strong>How does nightlife inform your work as an artist -- and vice verse?</strong><br />\n",
        "Nightlife in some ways is like stepping into a fantasy world. Once you're on the stage, with theatrical lighting, pounding music and a crowd that is typically prepared and hoping to be dazzled, you have an opportunity that is very difficult to create in a theater, gallery or museum. On a good night the energy is palpable and you can channel that right into your performance. Through regularly inhabiting that space week after week -- because it is expected, as well as to avoid burnout or boredom -- you can do just about anything you like as a performer. The more bizarre or unexpected the better. I'd say that simply go-go dancing on a regular basis has made me a much better performer. Not to mention that the visuals/costumes/makeup that one can create are without any boundaries -- it's a tremendously free forum, which is always demanding more, more, more.     <br />\n",

        "<strong>How has your work in nightlife given you a platform to draw awareness to HIV and combat HIV stigma?</strong><br />\n",
        "Honestly, there hasn't been a huge crossover there. As a spokesperson for the <a href=\"http://hivstopswithme.org/ny/darrell%E2%80%99s-bio\" target=\"_hplink\">HIV Stops With Me</a> Campaign that I've been involved with for the past eight years, we've discussed creating one of my ads with me in costume. Certainly I could have done that, but it never felt quite right. My main objective with the campaign is to combat stigma by being out about my status, and having my name and face associated with that. For me it's about transparency and openness, showing that being HIV positive is just one part of my experience. Conversely, when I'm in a club and in a look, I'm ultimately performing something that is outside of/greater than/other than my day to day existence. I always maintain an openness about my status, should it ever come up, and there have been occasions backstage to have chats with other performers. Aside from that, interviews or exposure like this -- which wouldn't have happened without nightlife -- <em>do</em> provide a platform.   <br />\n",

I think that's what our generation has to offer -- the idea of acceptance and blurred lines of gender. It's causing discussion, debate, new laws to be made and it's causing more art. THAT is the movement that's happening\"</em> -- How do you see this playing out in nightlife?</strong><br />\n",
        "I quite agree that gender and sexuality are on the forefront of the winds of change during our time, and I certainly see that manifested in a myriad of ways in nightlife -- through looks, identities and performance.  However, and I may be a bit naive here, I don't know that nightlife will necessarily change the world. It's fantastic for those who wish to participate, but I see nightlife as one microcosm in an ocean of many. I think the importance of nightlife might be more for those who find in it a place to feel accepted, a place to live out some fantasies or experiences they might not be able to in other settings, and a chance to dance it out a bit. Of course, I suppose it's what people take away from their experience in nightlife which may affect change in their circles -- large or small.  <br />\n",

        "Few people come away clean in Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's \"Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance),\" a scathing satire that takes down Hollywood blockbusters, entitled actors, celebrity culture, entertainment journalism, critics and the entirety of social media with gleeful abandon. There are jokes about Robert Downey Jr., Jeremy Renner and Meg Ryan that leave bruises. A heavy Oscar favorite since it premiered at the Venice Film Festival in August, and this year's closing night selection for the New York Film Festival, \"Birdman\" sets fire to so many bridges that it's a surprise <a href=\"http://www.thereviewsarein.com/2010/09/09/may-the-bridges-i-burn-light-the-way/\" target=\"_hplink\">Dylan McKay isn't the screenwriter</a>. (In fact, I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, Nicol\u00e1s Giacobone, Alexander Dinelaris and Armando Bo are the four credited writers.)<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "The existential tone of \"Birdman\" extended to the all-star cast during the film's post-screening press conference on Saturday afternoon at the New York Film Festival. Amid shutter clicks and Instagram uploads, Michael Keaton, Edward Norton and Zach Galifiankis grappled with the notion of being celebrities in 2014.<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "\"Being a celebrity is shit,\" Galifianakis said when asked about blurring the lines between performance and reality for the film. \"It's dumb. I'm not interested in it. I like to be an actor and that's it. The blurred lines are, I think, man-made. I think celebrity is a man-made thing. It's not innate in us. We have people telling us we should pay attention to these people for the wrong reasons -- their personal lives and that stuff.\"<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "Galifianakis said the cast of \"Birdman\" -- which also includes Emma Stone, Naomi Watts, Amy Ryan and Andrea Riseborough -- held views similar to his own, before making special mention of his dislike for \"picture taking\" (an ironic comment considering the audience was busy capturing photos of Galifianakis during his response).<br />\n",

        "<br />\n",
        "\"I think everybody is kind of a celebrity now. Anybody can be anything,\" Keaton added. The 63-year-old stars as Riggan Thomson in \"Birdman,\" a washed-up actor who became famous for playing a superhero and now hopes to save his career by putting on a Broadway production of Raymond Carver's \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.\" (<a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2014/10/scenes-from-the-birdman-set.html\" target=\"_hplink\">Keaton, a former Batman, has downplayed the surface similarities between Thomson and himself</a>. \"I related less to him than almost every other character I've played, in terms of the desperation,\" he told Lane Brown at New York Magazine.)<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "\"While [the public is] enamored by it, I guess, and buy magazines, I don't think [celebrity] is a big deal anymore,\" Keaton continued during the press conference. \"I think everybody is kind of their own celebrity in their own head, and they kind of are. We're living in this really weird world where people are everywhere. They're omnipresent.\"<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "Or, as Norton said: \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grEypMDqvTE\" target=\"_hplink\">The dog who runs into a wall dreaming</a> is a bigger celebrity than anyone on this stage.\"<br />\n",

To mount such an exhibition in what amounts to a war zone is unique and heroic. The choice of the Biennial's name, <em>Qalandiya</em>, is significant. It refers to the notorious checkpoint that isolates Palestine from Jerusalem and the rest of the world. For Palestinians, it's a daily reminder of unimaginable violence and suffering.

        "Out Oct. 14, courtesy of Abrams, comes \"Star Wars Art: Posters.\" The fifth and final installment in a series of books curated by George Lucas and Lucasfilm includes \"Star Wars\" art from around the world in one handy place. All six \"Star Wars\" films are represented in \"Posters,\" as are \"'Droids' and 'Star Wars: The Clone Wars' animated television series, radio dramatizations, gallery exhibitions, fan-club exclusives, foreign one-sheets, video games, and limited-edition posters curated and commissioned by Mondo Tees in Texas.\" From the book's official press release: <br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "<blockquote>Few pieces of artwork have ignited the imagination and distilled the passion for Star Wars as much as the original posters created to publicize and market the franchise\u2019s films, television shows, and video games. From Howard Chaykin\u2019s first advance poster, released to comic-book shops and distributed at the New York and San Diego Comic Cons in the summer of 1976, through Roger Kastel\u2019s Gone with the Wind\u2013inspired one-sheet for Episode V and Drew Struzan\u2019s striking, now-iconic paintings for all six films, Star Wars has enjoyed nearly four decades of poster art from some of the most renowned and beloved artists and designers working in movies.</blockquote><br />\n",

        "To celebrate the release (<a href=\"http://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-reads-day-strikes-back-october-11-2014\" target=\"_hplink\">and Star Wars Reads Day</a>), HuffPost Entertainment is happy to debut nine images from the pages of \"Star Wars Art: Posters.\" For more on the book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Art-LucasFilm-Ltd/dp/1419714007\" target=\"_hplink\">head to Amazon</a>.<br />\n",

        "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/11/chrissy-teigen-nip-slip_n_5968400.html?utm_hp_ref=arts&ir=Arts\n",
        "The year's most beautiful sheer-blouse, eyes-closed, on-the-grass photo definitely goes to supermodel Chrissy Teigen. But what she didn't realize at the time of posting it to Instagram was that her nipple was just as prominent as the face of her husband, John Legend.<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "The 28-year-old, who made her debut in Sports Illustrated's annual Swimsuit Issue in 2010, doesn't seem to care. \"A nipple is a nipple is a nipple. They are all the same,\" she laughed to The Huffington Post over a glass of ros\u00e9 after the Variety Power of Women Luncheon in Beverly Hills, California on Friday.<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "Reflecting on the room full of impressively powerful women being honored for their philanthropy at the lunch -- including Jane Fonda, Reese Witherspoon, Viola Davis and Jennifer Lopez -- Teigen couldn't help but feel inspired. \"My eyes were watering most of the ceremony. Coming to these events makes me feel so lazy,\" she confessed. <br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "Her greatest inspiration --like many women, she noted -- is her own mother. \"A good mommy is so important, because that\u2019s your heart and soul. There\u2019s a bond between a daughter and a mom.\" But the bond between Teigen and her mother sounds like it also includes a healthy dose of laughter. <br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "Sighing that her mom is the first to retweet anything, including rumors about her own daughter, Teigen revealed that she never got a ton of advice growing up. \"They really let me be me all the time, which I think is its own kind of advice,\" she said. \"They trusted me and I grew into this very outspoken person. But my mom is my biggest cheerleader. She created this.\"<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "In fact, the nip slip isn't the first time Teigen has bared skin on Instagram. Through fits of laughter, she told HuffPost Entertainment that her mother was actually the one who snapped the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/08/chrissy-teigen-nude-photo-instagram_n_2837591.html\" target=\"_hplink\">naked spray tan pic</a> that got her in the most trouble online. \"She is hysterical. She just sits there with wine and giggles. We always had a very naked-friendly household.\"<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "All kinds of female empowerment were the theme at the Variety luncheon, and Teigen says she identifies with being a feminist. In fact, she loves the label. \"People have sorely messed up the definition of feminism. It isn\u2019t saying this is wrong and this is right. It\u2019s having the power to do whatever the fuck you want. It\u2019s about having your own beliefs and staying true to them.\"<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "With the rising tide of <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/25/famous-male-feminists-men-support-women_n_5564005.html\" target=\"_hplink\">men declaring themselves as feminists too</a>, she interjected that Legend is definitely part of the club. \"He\u2019s a bigger feminist than I am! He actually teaches me a lot about the way women should be perceived.\"<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "Attributing this quality, in part, to the driven and accomplished women he has always surrounded himself with, Teigen remembered her own feelings of self-doubt when she was only 21 and they had just started dating. \"I was so intimidated just at how brilliant and driven they were. I felt like such an idiot.\"<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "She would come home from their group dinners together and cry, she said. \"But he would always explain to me that there are so many different ways to be a strong woman.\" <br />\n",

        "Lena Dunham discussed a wide array of topics with writer and author Ariel Levy during the <a href=\"http://festival.newyorker.com/events/lena-dunham-talks-with-ariel-levy\" target=\"_hplink\">15th annual New Yorker Festival on Friday night</a>, including her aspirations to turn <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Catherine-Called-Birdy-Karen-Cushman/dp/0547722184\" target=\"_hplink\">Karen Cushman's \"Catherine, Called Birdy\"</a> into a feature film.<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "\"This is actually my first time talking about it publicly,\" Dunham said about the project. \"I'm very excited about it. I'm not sure when it'll happen, but I'm in the process of [working on it].\"<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "Written by Cushman, the 1994 novel -- which won the Newbury Prize in 1995 -- tells the story of Catherine, a 12-year-old coming of age in 1290 England. \"[She] gets her period and her father basically says, 'Well, it's time for you to get married,' and she's like, 'Uh, no,'\" Dunham told the crowd. \"But it's hyper realistic and really pretty and it's full of incest and beatings, but it's a child's story. I've been obsessed with it since I was a kid.\" Dunham previously cited \"Catherine, Called Birdy\" <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/22/books/review/the-creator-of-hbos-girls-shares-her-reading-habits.html\" target=\"_hplink\">as one of the two best books she's ever read about young girls in an interview with the New York Times in 2012</a>. (Her other selection was Vladimir Nabokov's \"Lolita.\")<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "\"It's a really interesting examination of sort of like coming of age and what's expected of teenage girls,\" Dunham said. \"I'm going to adapt it and hopefully direct it, I just need to find someone who wants to fund a PG-13 medieval movie.\" <br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "Dunham plans to produce the film through A Casual Romance, the production company she started with \"Girls\" executive producer Jenni Konner. According the 28-year-old, \"Catherine, Called Birdy\" is one of many projects the duo are working on at the moment \"that sort of aren't set in the here and now.\"<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "\"Nothing I've done so far has required any research of any real kind beyond, like, going to a diner,\" Dunham said, acknowledging how \"Catherine, Called Birdy\" is not necessarily what some fans have come to expect from her as a writer-director. \"So this is a whole other world. But the source material makes me so happy and I'm so excited, because I've been working on 'Girls' [for five years] and I also wrote this book of personal essays. So the idea of engaging with some of these topics that are important to me, which are -- surprise -- women and feminism, but finding a way to kind of look at them through a historical lens is sort of like where feel myself going.\"<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",

        "<br />\n",
        "Like many Facebook users,<a href=\"http://www.tanjaalexiahollander.com/\" target=\"_hplink\"> Tanja Hollander</a> realized that when she was sharing information on the social network, some of the people reading her posts she was in constant communication with, while others she barely knew. Some, she didn\u2019t really know at all. She wondered: \u201cAm I really friends with all of these people?\u201d<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "That question would evolve as she traveled through 43 states and five countries, averaging two weeks of travel per month, to photograph every one of her Facebook friends for her project Are You Really My Friend (she didn\u2019t include people she added since beginning the project in 2011). She is currently trying to figure out how to translate this project into a March 2017 show at Mass MoCA that will include all the portraits plus accounts of her experiences both on the road and via social media since she began the ambitious undertaking. <br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m obsessed with right now, trying to visualize all the data,\u201d Hollander said about the intriguing connections that come up when meeting people for the project. \u201cAll of these experiences I\u2019m having to me are almost more important than taking the picture of the people. So how do I visualize all of these experiences besides saying go to my Instagram feed or let me tell you this cool story?\u201d<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "All of the portraits for the project have been shot on film, which in some ways might seem like a paradox for a project that delves deep into the modern, digital oriented virtual world. For Hollander it\u2019s the only thing that made sense, although she does bring along an iPhone and digital point and shoot camera for backup.<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m going back to film,\u201d she said. \u201cI never left film. I went from records to an iPod. I\u2019ve always shot film and it\u2019s funny because I\u2019m doing a super tech project\u2014I\u2019m not a techie at all\u2014I came kicking and screaming into even using Photoshop.\u201d<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "Most photographers will tell you that shooting film also slows things down. To keep things casual and less intimidating for her subjects, Hollander travels by herself with no light kits and no assistants, armed only with her Hasselblad camera, a couple rolls of film and a tripod. Not only does it bring down the tension for her subjects, it has also affected Hollander.<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "\u201cI\u2019m a much nicer person now because you have to be,\u201d she said about making the portraits. \u201cYou can\u2019t be a jerk when you go into someone\u2019s house to take a picture.\u201d<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "Working on the project has also reshaped Hollander\u2019s definition of what a friend is, although she isn\u2019t convinced there is much difference between online relationships and those based in \u201creality.\u201d She said friends have always represented different roles from those you might only run into at an art show to those with whom you share more intimate details of your life.<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "\u201cThe word friend is hard because Facebook took it and corporatized it,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a person who loves meeting people and I\u2019m always introducing people \u2026 I would say I definitely have a connected network of people and I think Facebook just mimicked what I already had and made it easier to connect with people.\u201d<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "So far, the majority of people Hollander contacted about participating in the project have agreed to sit for her. Her sister and her wife liked theirs; her parents, not so much (\u201cI don\u2019t think they really understood what I was doing and it was the first time they\u2019ve seen themselves portrayed in this way.\u201d) Hollander said she tries reaching out to people few times about taking their portrait and if they don\u2019t have the courtesy to respond to her request, she unfriends them. <br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "She made a conscious decision to shoot her exes last, something she might end up changing. \u201cI\u2019m starting to think that\u2019s not the best idea to save all the people I don\u2019t want to see,\u201d she laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s going to suck the last six months!\u201d She added that simply going into each home is emotional enough.<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "\u201cThe emotional part is hard because I never know what situation I\u2019m going to walk into, even with close friends. You never know what\u2019s happened in the last couple of days\u2014and when I\u2019m there, I\u2019m in it!\u201d<br />\n",
